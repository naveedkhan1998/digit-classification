# Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

Follow these steps to create a Python virtual environment and run your project:

## Step 1: Install `virtualenv`

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

This command installs the `virtualenv` package, which is necessary for creating isolated Python environments.

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This command sets up a new virtual environment in a directory named `venv`.

## Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
# On Windows
. venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS and Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

Activating the virtual environment isolates your Python environment and ensures that you use the packages installed within the environment.

## Step 4: Install Project Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command installs the required packages listed in your `requirements.txt` file.

## Step 5: Run Your Project

Now you can run your project using the appropriate commands or scripts.

These steps will help you set up and run your Python project within a clean and isolated virtual environment.
